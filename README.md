# Dynamic Vehicle routing Problem with ACO HH and reinforcement learning

This repo solves the dynamic vehical routing problem with a novel approach using reinforcement learning along with ant colony optimization hyper heuristic.

Run "dvrpwet.py" to see the output of novel approach compared to greedy approach.

Run "dvrp.py" to see the output of standard ACO with hyper heuristic without reinforcement learning approach compared to greedy approach.
